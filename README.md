# Reservation-Assistance-with-Speech-Recognition
-  As part of an in-class project, designed a framework for running virtual assistance for querying and processing reservations via Amazon Echo, Slack, AWS Lambda and RDS.  
-  The framework takes in user (text/voice) input and identifies the function the user wishes to use, interact with database for given instructions, and then return spoken responses.
